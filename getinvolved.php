  			<h2 class="mb-4">State Policy Positions</h2>
  			<ol>
		      	<li class="mb-3">Encourage creative public/private partnerships that (a) encourage “broadband friendly” local policies, (b) build upon current publicly available networks, (c) utilize private funding for major investment (a WestNGN strategy), and (d) encourage partnerships that include electrical utilities by reviewing state laws to eliminate barriers to entry for providers. At a minimum, resist any pressure from incumbents to add further limits on what counties/cities can do.</li>
		      	<li class="mb-3">Support allowing counties and municipalities to install dark fiber and to lease to private providers in rural areas with the understanding that cost would be recovered by a percentage of the gross revenue (not profit).</li>
		      	<li class="mb-3">Support the state’s Information Technology Office in adequately mapping current fiber locations, measuring actual internet speed, serving as a resource for local communities and advocating for broadband in the state.</li>
		      	<li class="mb-3">Fund innovative initiatives in rural communities to provide health care, education, and economic development opportunities via high-speed broadband technologies.</li>
		      	<li class="mb-3">Encourage the Dept. of Transportation to allow rural counties and cities to utilize unused dark fiber in the NCDOT network.</li>
